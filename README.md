This is very basic and simple website built for SJ Guitars. SJ Guitars is an imaginary Company Founded by me last month.
Currently this website is not purely responsive. But I'm working on it.

The main logo of the website is made with canva including hero-image<br>
<img src="/img/Logo.svg" alt="Main Logo" style="height: 200px; width:200px;"/>
<img src="/img/hero-bg.png" alt="Hero-bg" style="height: 200px; width:500px;"/>

Canva is a part of Github Students developer pack.
